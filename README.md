# Flask Vulnerability Scanner

(Still Making Modifications!)

The Flask Vulnerability Scanner is a web application designed to test and identify common web vulnerabilities in a given URL. Specifically, this application targets two prevalent security issues:

- SQL Injection (SQLi): The scanner checks for SQL injection vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests to the target URL. It looks for signs of SQL errors in the response that indicate potential weaknesses in the database handling.

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The scanner tests for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting a script payload into the URL. If the application reflects this payload to the user without proper sanitization, it confirms the presence of an XSS vulnerability.

## How It Works
1. Input: The user enters a URL into the web application.
2. Scanning: The application sends test requests to the specified URL for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
3. Results: The application processes the responses and displays the results in a formatted manner, highlighting any identified vulnerabilities or confirming their absence.
